Last week I had an interview with a firm that asked me about my knowledge of  Mediatr as I had it listed it as a skill on my CV. I blathered on a bit about thin controllers, and reduced dependencies, but didn't really get to what makes Mediatr useful, or why you would use it. In short, i didn't understand it well enough.
